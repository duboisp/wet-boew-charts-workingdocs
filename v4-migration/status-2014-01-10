_(Copy and paste of my answer to a status update requested to me by email)_

I am hopping to have it ready for mergin early next week. I almost ready to send the PR. Also I created a new repository, instead of having it on paper, to help me during the coding, to allow others to follow my ongoing development and to provide a central way to provide technical draft documentation. (https://github.com/duboisp/wet-boew-charts-workingdocs/tree/master/v4-migration)

I may need help to find the best flot plugin to do side-by-side bar chart.


Before to send the PR, I need to

1. Complete the way that setting is applied

 I need to change the way that the wet charts specific options is obtained from the table. Currently it still CSS option but I am looking to change it to use a dedicated data attribute. 

 Like to use: 
 * ```data-flot``` for flot specific options
 * ```data-wet-boew``` for Charts specific options and define preset

 (FYI - https://github.com/duboisp/wet-boew-charts-workingdocs/issues/2) 

2. Find a stable Flot plugin for creating side-by-side bar chart

 _Currently that is simulated and I needed to remove temporary the support for staked chart_
 
 I found a few project that support it like:
 * http://en.benjaminbuffet.com/labs/flot/
 * https://github.com/pkoltermann/SideBySideImproved

 TODO:
 * Search for other existing solution
 * Test and evaluate side-by-side bar chart solution with a flot working example.
 * Make the best choice and add the plugin

3. Cleanup the code

 * Safetly Remove the function setClassOptions()
 * Move the JSON default setting for wet charts and flot at the begining of the file
 * Change the way the complex table parser is loaded (https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues/3624#issuecomment-31903589)

4. Update the working example

 Test if the visual charts result is what it is expected to be. (Screen shoot for basic reference are located here: https://github.com/duboisp/wet-boew-charts-workingdocs/tree/master/working-examples/v4-migration )
