Migration to WET 4 Architecture
===========================

_See completed change at the ends (v4 migration notes)_

Goal
---------------------------

* Use less code 
* Be small (kilo byte) (at least when compressed)
* Be faster as possible
* Take the full advantage of JEP (Javascript Event Programming)
* Write code with style (lint)

Currently Done - The Chart WET v4.0 migration notes
---------------------------

* The labeling strategy and code was fully re-written in order to be more clear and more usable.
* Default chart type was change for the default flot chart. That means *default are now a line chart* and bar chart need to be explicitly defined
* Custom Parameter for pie chart was changed from the data cell location to be set to the appropriate cell header.
* Any Flot parameter is now set by using the ```data-flot``` attribute. On the ```<table>``` for Flot global setting and on the appropriate ```<th>``` for Flot series setting.
* Charts specific setting use the ````data-wet-boew``` attribute.
* CSS options is now only a facilitator of applying/extending defaults settings 
* overwride setting with a Javascript function require to be defined in the object ```fn``` and the name of the function is a path to where it belong to. ex ```"/getcellvalue"```. The path structure is inspired by RFC6902 JSON Patch. It is like that because I have experienced some issue regarding to extend type that are javacript function where the declared function are ```deep``` into the setting. I know Flot have hierchical setting and can contain declared function ```deep``` in the setting. The ```$.extend(true, ...)``` said - On a deep extend, Object and Array are extended, but object wrappers on primitive types such as String, Boolean, and Number are not.
* Added support for flot plugin ```orderBars``` the revised version at https://github.com/pkoltermann/SideBySideImproved
* Working example, reworked and migrated
* adhoc preset integration will work with the global variable ```chartsGraphOpts``` where exist a direct child named  "flot", "series" or/and "charts"
* jquery.flot.orderBars.js provided from  https://github.com/pkoltermann/SideBySideImproved Added to the build script
* Modified the WET build script to support adhoc WET js dependency. That is done by adding file in the deps folder of the plugins.
* See pull request (PR): https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/pull/4398

On Going
---------------------------

Todo:


* Suggestion: Discuss about the name for the setting ```reverseTblParsing``` to know if it is enough meaningful as is and a web editior will know (by deduction) that the primary vector is the table column then the secondary vector is the table row. This is a reverse parsing methodology compared of what is written in the HTML5 specification in regards of how to parse a table.

### JSON Data

Goal: Use the flot data structure from a HTML data attribute set on a table element. 

Done for:

* Global flot setting (set on ```<table>``` element)
* 2d charts (area, bar, line)
* Pie charts (setting location is now set on the cell header)
* Global charts settings (set on ```<table>``` element)


#### Predefined Preset

By using a CSS option, it is possible to load preset, see pie.html working for an example.

It is also possible to extends a deeper function, the function name will look to ```/series/pie/labelformater```

#### A few working example

* http://universallabs.org//chartv4-dev/dist/unmin/demos/charts/pie-en.html
* http://universallabs.org//chartv4-dev/dist/unmin/demos/charts/labelsandreferencevalue-en.html
* http://universallabs.org//chartv4-dev/dist/unmin/demos/charts/pieparsevertical-en.html


#### Type of table elements 

* The container: ```<table>```
* Structural: ```<tr> <col> <thead> <tbody> <tfoot> <colgroup>```
* Informative: ```<caption> <th> <td>```


#### Suggestive choice

The container ```<table>``` elements will be the best place to carry any Global Option. 

The informative elements, more specificly the cell header ```<th>``` that represent the series (use to label the series) would be the better place to carry the series options

Any options set on informative elements like ```<caption> <td>``` will be ignored. 

The html contained in the ```<caption>``` will be copied (cloned) in the ```<figcaption>``` as is.

Only the value of the data cell and may be his quantifier would be extracted from the ```<td>```

Any options set on the structural element like ```<thead> <tbody> <tfoot> <colgroup>``` would be ignored.

May be considerate to use the vector structural elements ```<tr> <col>``` in order to provide a default for the first series (first data set). Summary data set would be out of scope for any options set to vectors elements.

Use Less Code
---------------------------

Suggested to let the web-editor to code a JSON string directly in a HTML5 data attribute and do almost literal transfer to flot


Be Small
---------------------------

Suggested to let the web-editor to code a JSON string directly in a HTML5 data attribute and do almost literal transfer to flot

Be Faster
---------------------------

By using JEP and do variable caching

Use JEP approach
---------------------------

Currently only the plugin use JEP. TODO: use a JEP structure inside the charts for each components

Be Styled
---------------------------

The grunt build script help to avoid minimal styling error.
